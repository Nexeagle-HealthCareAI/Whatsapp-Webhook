----------------------------------------
Symptom/specialty search & browsing domain. Currently holds only the pure, never-
monkeypatched part (row/group formatting). The async handlers
(_handle_choosing_search_mode, _send_search_mode_prompt, _handle_awaiting_symptom,
_send_specialty_list, _handle_choosing_specialty_group, _handle_choosing_specialty,
_send_sort_prompt, _handle_choosing_sort) stay in __init__.py for now -- see
docs/architecture.md and the approved plan for the lazy-import discipline they'll need
when they move here in a later phase.
